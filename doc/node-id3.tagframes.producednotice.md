## TagFrames.ProducedNotice type

The 'Produced notice' frame, in which the string must begin with a year and a space character (making five characters), is intended for the production copyright holder of the original sound, not the audio file itself. The absence of this frame means only that the production copyright information is unavailable or has been removed, and must not be interpreted to mean that the audio is public domain. Every time this field is displayed the field must be preceded with "Produced " (P) " ", where (P) is one character showing a P in a circle.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type ProducedNotice = string;
```
