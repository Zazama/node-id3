## TagFrames.PlaylistDelay type

The 'Playlist delay' defines the numbers of milliseconds of silence between every song in a playlist. The player should use the "ETC" frame, if present, to skip initial silence and silence at the end of the audio to match the 'Playlist delay' time. The time is represented as a numeric string.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type PlaylistDelay = string;
```
